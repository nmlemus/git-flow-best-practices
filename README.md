# Release Please

https://github.com/googleapis/release-please

Release Please automate CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps for your projects.
It does so by parsing your git history, looking for Conventional Commit messages, and creating release PRs.
It does not handle publication to package managers or handle complex branch management.

# Commitizen

Commitizen is release management tool designed for teams.
Commitizen assumes your team uses a standard way of committing rules and from that foundation, it can bump your project's version, create the changelog, and update files.
By default, commitizen uses conventional commits, but you can build your own set of rules, and publish them.
Using a standardized set of rules to write commits, makes commits easier to read, and enforces writing descriptive commits.
